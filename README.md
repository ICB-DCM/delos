# DeLOS (Deep learning-inspired Local Optimization Schemes)

This is a first alpha-version of the DeLOS-Toolbox (so far writen im MATLAB).
DeLOS is a toolbox for local optimization, employing either mini-batch or full-batch optimization solvers, which are derived from deep learning community. It was originally developed to tackle ODE-constraint optimization problems, but it can be used for any kind of optimization given a deterministic objective function.
